I am currently reading various aspects restless bandits with Prof. Urtzi Ayesta and Prof. Maaike Verloop at INP-ENSEEIHT.

Before transitioning to Toulouse, I was working on pricing mechanism for health-care operations with Prof. Shruti and Prof. Ying at ESD. I graduated from the IEOR@IITB with my Ph.D. studying stochastic systems.
