 <p>I am an assistant professor in <a href = "https://doms.iitr.ac.in/" target="_blank">Management Studies</a>  at <a href = "https://www.iitr.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIT Roorkee</a>. I am also a joint faculty in <a href = "https://www.iitr.ac.in/mfsdsai/" target="_blank">MFS of Artificial Intelligence and Data Sciences</a>  at IIT Roorkee. </p>

<p>My research interests are broadly in decision making under uncertainty. In the past, I have worked on several areas such as machine learning, optimization, game theory and queuing systems. </p>

<p>On these pages you will be able to find a lot about my technical interests. I hope you enjoy them and find them helpful to what interests you. I believe that a curious mind along with good knowledge of techniques can systematically approach several challenging problems. </p>

<p>If you are interested in the areas that I work on/would like to provide suggestions/have discussions on any topic mentioned in this site, please drop me  a mail.</p>
