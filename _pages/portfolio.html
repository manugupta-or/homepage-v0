The web is a great place for expanding knowledge and online courses can be a good way of getting quick introduction to 
the subject. I try to keep myself updated with interesting technical things by taking online classes from time to time using platforms like coursera.


The classes I have taken include:
<p> </p>
<li>University College London course on <a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html" target="_top"><i>"Reinforcement Learning"</i></a> </li>
<li> Johns Hopkins University course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/unix"><i>"The Unix Workbench"</i></a>  </li>
