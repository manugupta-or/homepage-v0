from Manu to anu

He will be there for almost everyone 
but will never let his problems know to anyone 

Linux Latex and every tech is in his left hand
still he is very sweet and amiable friend

I wish I could follow him in every aspect 
but I find it difficult which increases his respect

Here is the god of IEOR
we'll miss his strong presence every hour


for AG from Kets


I'm known to take a stand,
Adored for my strong gut;
When there is a controversy,
I can barely keep shut

I turn a deaf year to criticism,
And to mostly everything else as well;
So I haven't heard you, be sure,
Unless there is gossip I smell

I won't move my legs,
Unless it's to kick someone's butt,
I smoke away to glory,
It's become a rut

There is no God,
God damn it!
Casteism , misogyny and animal abuse,
I slam it!

An unapologetic lover,
A selfless giver
Sometimes annoying,
But will be your friend forever!


For Kets from RT

Kind, faithful and caring,
Epitome of emotional sensitivity - yes, I am.
Trust betrayed - I can't accept,
Kith and kin - needless to say, I treasure the most.
I love what makes me who I am. 

Kicking injustice out of my life,
Unabated is my hunger until I gobble a chocolate.
Lifting trophies - I take pride in,
Keen on fighting sexism - yes, my passion.
Articulating my thoughts - I do the best,
Reigning over at all the places I go.
Never can I love my friends in halves,
I carry their moments always with me - treading soulfully.
